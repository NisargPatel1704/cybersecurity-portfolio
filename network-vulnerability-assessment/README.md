## Workflow Overview

This project mirrors a typical assessment workflow:
1.  **Configure & Scan**: The `scan_network.sh` script (driven by `scan_config.cfg`) runs detailed Nmap scans, including service versioning and vulnerability scripts.
2.  **Collect Data**: Raw scan outputs (in XML format) are saved to the `scans/` directory.
3.  **Automate Reporting**: The `generate_report.py` script parses the XML data, analyzes the findings, generates visualizations, and compiles everything into a professional PDF document.



---

## Features

-   [cite_start]**Configurable Scanning**: Easily define targets, scan intensity, and Nmap script categories in a simple `.cfg` file[cite: 2].
-   **Automated Bash Scripting**: A robust `scan_network.sh` script builds and executes complex Nmap commands based on your configuration.
-   **Advanced XML Parsing**: The Python report generator uses `lxml` and `pandas` to intelligently parse scan results, extracting hosts, open ports, services, versions, and NSE vulnerability data.
-   [cite_start]**Data Visualization**: Automatically generates charts (e.g., Top 10 Open Services) using `matplotlib` to provide a clear visual summary of the findings[cite: 6].
-   **Professional PDF Reporting**: Creates a multi-page PDF report with a title page, executive summary, data visualizations, and detailed, tabulated findings using `reportlab`.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have **Nmap** installed on your system and available in your PATH.
    bash
    # On Debian/Ubuntu
    sudo apt-get install nmap
    

2.  **Clone the portfolio repository:**
    bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/CYBERSECURITY-PORTFOLIO.git](https://github.com/your-username/CYBERSECURITY-PORTFOLIO.git)
    

3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    bash
    cd CYBERSECURITY-PORTFOLIO/network-vulnerability-assessment
    

4.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    bash
    # Create the venv
    python -m venv venv

    # Activate on Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate on macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    

5.  **Install the required libraries:**
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Follow these three simple steps to perform a scan and generate a report.

### Step 1: Configure Your Scan

[cite_start]Edit the `scan_config.cfg` file to define your target IP addresses or subnets[cite: 2].
ini
# Example: Scan a local subnet
TARGETS="192.168.1.0/24"
`

### Step 2: Execute the Scan Script

Run the bash script to perform the Nmap scan. This will create a timestamped folder inside `scans/` containing the raw XML output.

bash
# Make the script executable (only need to do this once)
chmod +x scan_network.sh

# Run the scan
./scan_network.sh


### Step 3: Generate the PDF Report

Point the Python report generator to the XML file created in the previous step.

bash
# Example for a scan file located in scans/results_20250901_183000/
python scripts/generate_report.py -i scans/results_20250901_183000/nmap_results.xml


The final PDF report and any generated charts will be saved in the `reports/` directory.

## Sample Report

The generated PDF includes:

  - A professional title page.
  - An executive summary section.
  - A bar chart visualizing the most common open services.
  - A detailed table listing each finding with IP Address, Port, Service, Version, and discovered vulnerabilities.
